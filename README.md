#Information security


Information security is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer system data from those 
with malicious intentions. 
Confidentiality, integrity and availability are sometimes referred to as the CIA Triad of information security. 
This triad has evolved into what is commonly termed the Parkerian hexad, which includes confidentiality, possession, integrity, 
authenticity, availability and utility.
